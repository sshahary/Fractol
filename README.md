hey there!!
its my first ever graphical project in Cprogramming...
Fractol is a program that generates visualizations of well-known fractals, including the Mandelbrot set, Julia set, and Tricorn fractal.
These fractals are fascinating mathematical structures that exhibit intricate and beautiful patterns.
